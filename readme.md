# FlockingAI - URP

This Unity (Universal Render Pipeline) 2019.3 project embellishes upon
learnings from the UnityLearn class "AI for Beginners", in particular the 
Flocking/Avoidance Crowd AI sections presented by Dr Penny de Byl @ [Holistic3d.com](https://holistic3d.com/)


This project looks at code that enables digital fish to swim around an environment, 
with AI code to allow them to flock in groups, as well as avoid other fish and obstacles.

Cinemachine, Post Processing, and Shadergraph components added for effect, with some
code experimentation with VolumeComponent (LensDistortion) to create a 'watery'
screen view.
Shadergraph shaders for textures to also create a 'caustic' light simulation.

This project utilizes the **Stylized Sand Pillar**, a FREE asset in the Unity Asset store.
